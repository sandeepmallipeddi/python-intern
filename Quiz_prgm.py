This code consists of functions,classes.
At first to design this I donâ€™t know about classes in python. Later I learnt them from W3 schools and chatgpt.
With the help of W3 schools and chatgpt I can complete the code.
This code displays the question and options.
Next, we have choose one number from the numbering given to the options.
Then the input is validated. After the completion of all questions.
The final score is displayed.
